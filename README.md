# Hacker News Enhancement

A modern, readable, and comfortable dark theme for Hacker News that respects the classic design while making your time on the site much more enjoyable.

## What is this?
This is a custom **CSS stylesheet** that upgrades the look of Hacker News in your desktop browser. It doesn't change how the site works or remove any features, it simply gives it a refined, modern look.

If you find yourself reading long threads or spending hours on HN, this theme is designed to reduce eye strain and make that reading experience smoother.

## What it is NOT
- It is **not** a browser extension (you need a separate tool to use it).
- It is **not** a script that alters site functionality.
- It is **not** an official update from Y Combinator.

## What does it do?
The default Hacker News design is functional but can be harsh, especially during long reading sessions or at night. This CSS improves the experience by:

*   🌙 **True Dark Mode:** Replaces the bright beige background with a soft dark gray palette that is much easier on the eyes.
*   ☕ **More Enjoyable Reading:** Increases spacing between lines and paragraphs, giving discussions breathing room so you can read comfortably for longer.
*   🎨 **Modern Polish:** Updates buttons, search inputs, and code blocks to look cleaner, flatter, and more consistent.
*   ✨ **Consistent Design:** Navigational links (like "reply," "parent," "root") are unified so they look and behave the same way across the site.
*   ♿ **Accessible:** Improves contrast ratios and adds clear visual indicators for keyboard navigation.

## Features at a Glance
- **Comfortable Colors:** Carefully tuned dark grays and a muted orange accent.
- **Better Typography:** Adjusted font sizes and line heights for optimal readability.
- **Clean Layout:** Comments and threads are spaced out to prevent that "wall of text" feeling.

## How to Install

You can use this theme on any desktop browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). The easiest way is to use a browser extension called **Stylus**.

### Step 1: Install the Extension
First, you need an extension that allows you to add custom styles to websites.
*   **Chrome / Edge / Brave:** Install [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)
*   **Firefox:** Install [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)

*(Note: Please avoid the extension "Stylish" due to privacy concerns. "Stylus" is the recommended open-source alternative.)*

### Step 2: Add the Style
1.  Open [news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com).
2.  Click on the **Stylus icon** in your browser toolbar.
3.  Click the link that says **"Write style for: news.ycombinator.com"**.
4.  A new tab will open with a code editor.
5.  **Copy** the [CSS code](/style.css) from the file in this repository.
6.  **Paste** it into the main text box in Stylus.
7.  Give it a name on the left (e.g., "Hacker News Enhancement").
8.  Click **Save**.
9.  Strongly suggested: enable **Instant inject mode** in Stylus Advanced options to prevent white flashes when pages load.

### Step 3: Enjoy!
Go back to Hacker News and refresh the page. The new theme will be applied immediately.
